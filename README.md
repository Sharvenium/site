The Journey of Coding my Personal Website.
  - Using my Pro CSS and HTML skills that I learnt [here](freecodecamp.com)

1. 27/05/2020 - First Update. I just connected my site to my Atom editor and can now change the site using my local html file. Hopefully this first update sounds ridiculous like 6  months into the future. My blog is live at sharvenium.com where I upload blogs every week or so about the things that I learnt when procrastinating from doing homework.
2. 12/06/2020 - Second Update. This is harder than I thought it would be.
